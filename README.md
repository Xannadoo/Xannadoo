## Hej 👋

I'm Chrisanna, also known as Sanna.

👩‍🎓 I'm studying MSc Data Science at ITU Copenhagen, with a focus on explainability of LLMs, and machine learning models in general.

🧠 I am interested in knowing why. More specifically, why do machine learning models make the decisions they do/return the response they did? 
How do we go about creating these explanations and how reliable are the explanations? What can we trust **and** how much can we trust it?
What do we even mean by that anyway?

🎆 Fun fact: The name Xannadoo comes from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem [Kubla Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubla_Khan). Many years ago, a collegue of mine misheard my name and it stuck. I also used to live in the birthplace of Coleridge, Ottery St Mary, before moving to Denmark.
