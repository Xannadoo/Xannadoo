## Hej ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chrisanna, otherwise know as Sanna.

I'm studying MSc Data Science at ITU Copenhagen, with a focus on explainability of ML models.

I am interested in knowing why. More specifically, why do machine learning models make the decisions they do? Why did they return the response they did? How do we go about creating explainations and how reliable is that process? 

Fun fact: The name Xannadoo comes from Coleridge's poem Kubla Khan. Many years ago, a collegue of mine misheard my name and it stuck. I also used to live in the birthplace of Coleridge, Ottery St Mary before moving to Denmark.
